variable? its a data name which can hold values , values can be change 

data type ? 
    char int float double
    long double 

    int -> can hold posive values and negative values 

    what if we want to store only posive values? 
    unsigned int x;

    unsigned -> this indicates compiler that we have to store values wihtout sign - no negative values allowed 

    by default int is ->  signed int -> so you can store both positive and negative 

    char => %c 
    int => %d 
    float => %f 
    double => %lf 
    unsigned int => %u
